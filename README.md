ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Phuc, currently a student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at VNU University of Science.

ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about building Android Native applications using Java and Kotlin. I enjoy exploring surrounding technologies, developing useful and creative features, and focusing on delivering high-quality UX/UI.

ðŸ’¡ My strong background in math and computer science gives me a structured and logical approach to problem-solving, while my experience in native Android development allows me to build performant, responsive, and user-friendly mobile apps.

ðŸš€ I'm always eager to learn new tools, contribute to real-world projects, and push the limits of what mobile applications can do. Whether it's integrating modern libraries, improving app architecture, or refining user experienceâ€”I enjoy every part of the process.
